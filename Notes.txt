Meeting 3/14/25
- how do we denote two items that are altered states of eachother, other than trusting user to have valid name?
e.g. baked chicken != raw chicken when comparing IIDs, however they are more equal than raw chicken and raw brocolli.

- standardize IID format, parser, and IID related code into an IID class. 
- change "component" to "tag", formalize IID definition? 
- Exception throwing
- organizing code
- individual driver classes (branches?)
- tag interface
