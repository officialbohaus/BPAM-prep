     * -The recipe class should take an ingredient set and pair each IID in the set with a quantity value.
     *      -This pairing can be done multiple ways, a matching array may be easy, the PantryNode class already has this functionality too.
     * -The class should maintain some sort of "steps" for the recipe. Up to programmer how to implement
     *      - May be useful to have a RecipeStep class,  that has ingredient in and ingredient out, along with processing of said ingredient?
     * - The class should also have a recipe description and name.
     * - Appropriate getters, setter, and constructors
